# txAdmin-Logs

## What is it?

I initally created this resource back in June just never got around to completing it until tonight. This script essentially logs all the public events written inside the txAdmin resource. These logs cover majority of Admin actions at least the essential ones. Enjoy :)

## Configuration

The following can be found in the ``config.lua`` file.
```
    Settings = {
    txAdminLogs = {
        Webhook = ''
    }
    Debug = {
        Toggle = false
    }
  }
```
Once you set up the webhook you should be good to go!
